### R-Club Homework

I wonder if I can link this to [GitHub](www.github.com)?  
I cannot figure out how to do the referencing of images, **pleas help!** I think I can do the in line image insertion ![Smiley face](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Yellow_Happy.jpg).

### My three South African heros are

* _Nelson Mandela_  
 > Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.  
* _Desmond Tutu_  
 > Do your little bit of good where you are; it's those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.  
* _Helen Suzman_  
 > I am provocative, and I admit this. It isn't as if I'm only on the receiving end, a poor, frail little creature. I can be thoroughly nasty when I get going, and I don't pull my punches.

There is _**very**_ likely more than one error in this!
